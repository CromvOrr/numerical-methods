# Numerical Methods

### [WFAIS.IF-B206.0]

This repository contains my solutions for the **Numerical Methods** course, implemented in **C++**.<br> The primary focus is on implementing various algorithms, with computations powered by the [**Eigen**](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) library.

I have encountered various problems, such as:

- Solving systems of linear equations
- Eigenvalue and eigenvector computations
- Interpolation and curve fitting
- Root-finding algorithms

For ease of use, a **Makefile** is included - it simplifies the compilation and execution process.

Windows users can use `make run` to compile and run the program.<br> To clean up all files generated by compiling and running the program, use `make clean`.
